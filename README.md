   - Define the customizable elements (e.g., type of chocolate, ingredients, packaging, etc.).
   - Clarify any special features or constraints.

2. **Design and Wireframing:**
   - Create wireframes or design mockups of the customizer interface.
   - Plan the user journey and interaction flow.
   - Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive design.

3. **Selecting Technology Stack:**
   - Choose appropriate technologies based on project requirements.
   - Consider using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies.
   - Popular front-end frameworks/libraries include React, Vue.js, or Angular.
   - Common back-end technologies are Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel.

4. **Database Design:**
